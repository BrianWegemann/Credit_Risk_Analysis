# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview
### We were tasked with using a LendingClub dataset and a number of useful algorithms to predict credit risk, and to report our findings on which models should be used for this purpose in the future.

## Results
* Oversampling

## Summary of Results
### After our review, we can say that each model accurately predicted low risk loans. The Easy Ensemble and Balanced Random Forest classifiers had the highest values for predicting high risk loans and should be selected if that is the target.
